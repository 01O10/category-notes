# Relations and Functions

In mathematics and computer science, functions and relations play a crucial role in structuring information and defining transformations between sets. This lesson explores the concepts of relations, functions, and their properties, including invertibility and isomorphism.

# Relations

## What is a Relation?

A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs where elements from one set are associated with elements from another set.

For example, if we have two sets:

-   $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
-   $B = \{a, b, c\}$

A relation between them could be:

$$
R = \{(1, a), (2, b), (3, c)\}
$$

## Relations and Cartesian Products

A relation can be understood through the **Cartesian product** of two sets. The Cartesian product $A \times B$ consists of all possible pairs:

$$
A \times B = \{(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c), (3, a), (3, b), (3, c)\}
$$

A relation is simply a subset of this Cartesian product.

# Functions

## What is a Function?

A **function** is a special type of relation that has a well-defined **directionality**: each input from the **domain** is mapped to exactly one output in the **codomain**.

## Key Properties of Functions

-   A function **must** assign exactly **one** output to each input.
-   The **domain** is the set of all possible inputs.
-   The **codomain** is the set of possible outputs (though not necessarily all elements in the codomain are used).
-   The actual values a function maps to are called the **image** of the function.

For example, if we define a function $f: A \to B$ as:

$$
f(x) = x^2, \quad A = \{1, 2, 3\}, \quad B = \{1, 4, 9, 10\}
$$

Then:

$$
f(1) = 1, \quad f(2) = 4, \quad f(3) = 9
$$

## Total Functions vs. Partial Functions

-   A **total function** maps **every** element of the domain to an element in the codomain.
-   A **partial function** may leave some elements of the domain unmapped.

# Invertibility of Functions

## When is a Function Invertible?

A function is **invertible** if there exists another function that can reverse its effect. That is, given an output, we can determine the unique input that produced it.

**Example:** If $f(x) = x + 2$, the inverse function is $g(x) = x - 2$, because applying $g$ after $f$ returns the original input:

$$
g(f(x)) = (x + 2) - 2 = x
$$

Not all functions are invertible! A function must be **bijective** (both injective and surjective) to have an inverse.

# Isomorphism: A Special Kind of Invertibility

## What is an Isomorphism?

An **isomorphism** is a function that has a perfect inverse—it maps one set to another in a way that preserves structure.

Given two functions:

-   $f: A \to B$
-   $g: B \to A$

$f$ and $g$ are isomorphic if:

$$
g \circ f = id_A \quad \text{and} \quad f \circ g = id_B
$$

where $id_A$ and $id_B$ are identity functions that return their input unchanged.

## Why are Functions Non-Isomorphic?

There are two main reasons why a function might not be an isomorphism:

### 1. Loss of Information: Non-Injective Functions

A function is **not injective** if multiple inputs map to the same output (collapsing elements).

**Example:** $$
f(x) = x^2
$$

Here, both $f(2) = 4$ and $f(-2) = 4$, so the function is not invertible because we lose information about whether the input was positive or negative.

-   **Opposite Property:** A function is **injective** (one-to-one) if no two inputs map to the same output.
-   **Related concept:** **Monomorphism (monic functions).**

### 2. Incomplete Coverage: Non-Surjective Functions

A function is **not surjective** if it does not cover the entire codomain.

**Example:** Suppose $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by:

$$
f(x) = e^x
$$

Since the function never produces negative numbers, it is not surjective onto $\mathbb{R}$.

-   **Opposite Property:** A function is **surjective** (onto) if it covers the entire codomain.
-   **Related concept:** **Epimorphism (epic functions).**

# Bijections and Isomorphism

A function is:

-   **Injective** if it preserves uniqueness (one-to-one).
-   **Surjective** if it covers the entire codomain (onto).
-   **Bijective** if it is both injective and surjective, meaning it has a perfect inverse.

## Why is a Bijective Function an Isomorphism?

A **bijective function** is an **isomorphism** because it:

1.  Preserves uniqueness (no collapsing).
2.  Fully maps the codomain (no gaps).
3.  Has an inverse function that undoes its effect.

**Example:**\
The function $f(x) = x + 3$ is bijective because:

-   It is injective (each $x$ gives a unique output).
-   It is surjective (covers all real numbers).
-   It has an inverse $g(x) = x - 3$, making it an isomorphism.

# Conclusion

Understanding functions and relations helps in many fields, from mathematics to computer science. Knowing when a function is invertible, injective, or surjective allows us to determine how information is preserved, mapped, and structured.
